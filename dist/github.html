<p><a href="https://github.com/Clumsyndicate/AR-Calculator">The AR Calculator</a> is an iOS application that graphs lines and planes in the 3D space that ARKit provides to intuitively view the different 3d equations. It takes equations of both scalar and vector form.</p>

<h2 id="toc_1">Installation</h2>

<p>Intall Xcode IDE on MacOS. Clone this project and open AR-Calculator.xcodeproj. You will have to provide your own personal developer license to run the project.</p>

<h2 id="toc_2">Understanding the workings of the AR Calculator</h2>

<h3 id="toc_3">Draw a line from a scalar equation in 3D</h3>

<p>\(\frac{x-x_0}{a}=\frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{c}\)<br/>
The above equation is the scalar form of a line in 3-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system. The user will input six parameters, and AR Calculator will graph the line in an AR-simulated coordinate system.</p>

<h3 id="toc_4">Draw a plane from a cartesian equation in 3D</h3>

<p>\(ax+by+cz=d\)<br/>
where vector \(\vec{n}=\begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}\) is the normal vector of the plane. </p>

<h2 id="toc_5">Basics of ARKit</h2>

<p>Starting to play with ARKit is simple. In Xcode, choose <em>Create a new Project</em> and <em>Augmented Reality App</em>. The bare bone structure will be set up for you. The hierarchy of an ARKit app is ViewController &gt; ARSceneView (can be configured by WorldConfiguration) &gt; Scene.rootNode &gt; SCNNodes &gt; SCNGeometry. Just create Nodes with the geometry you want, and then add them to the rootNode of the Scene. </p>

<h3 id="toc_6">Drawing the coordinate axes</h3>

<p>The three axes are drawn with geometries as SCNCylinder. The default cylinder is upright, which is the y axis in the ARSceneView. So the x axis and the z axis are simply rotated 90 degrees in their respective directions. </p>

<h3 id="toc_7">Drawing a line</h3>

<p>The AR Calculator draws a line given in a Cartesian equation from a starting point \(K(x_k, y_k, z_k)\), which is the closest point between the line and the origin of the three-dimensional coordinate system. The position of \(K\) as the starting point could be determined.</p>

<p>In the line equation, we introduce a \(k\), with \(x_0, y_0, z_0, a, b, c\) as user inputs.</p>

<h1 id="toc_8">\(\frac{x-x_0}{a}=\frac{y-y_0}{b}=\frac{z-z_0}{c}=k\)</h1>

<p>Consequently<br/>
\(\begin{cases} x=ak+x_0 \\ y=bk+y_0 \\ z=cz+z_0 \end{cases}\tag{1}\)<br/>
We want to know the vector pointing towards the closest point \(\vec{K}\), which satisfies<br/>
\(\vec{K} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}=0\)<br/>
Since \(\vec{K}\) is on the line, <br/>
\(\vec{K}= \begin{pmatrix} ak+x_0 \\ bk+y_0 \\  cz+z_0\end{pmatrix}\)<br/>
\(\vec{K} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} a \\ b \\ c \end{pmatrix}=a^2k+x_0a+b^2k+y_0b+c^2k+z_0c=0\)<br/>
Therefore, we have</p>

<h1 id="toc_9">\(k=-\frac{x_0a+y_0b+z_0c}{a^2+b^2+c^2}\)</h1>

<p>Since all quantities in this expression of \(k\) is known, \(k\) could be calculated and substituted into \(\ref{1}\)</p>
